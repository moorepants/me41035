Assignments
===========

:sortorder: 1

The assignments will be done in groups comprised of four or five students. The
groups will be formed to mix students from the participating universities and
differing disciplines. The groups will be assigned the first day with an
opportunity to get to know each other. You'll perform your experiment on one or
more riders from your group and their chosen human-powered wheeled vehicle.

Groups will need to make use of simple tools and accessible data at your
disposal: tape measures, kilometer markers, stopwatches, smartphone sensors,
cameras, video cameras, GIS downloads, etc. Be clever and resourceful!

Assignment 1: Estimate Air and Rolling Resistance
=================================================

The primary objective of this assignment is to estimate the contributions of
air resistance and rolling resistance for at least one member of your group and
their vehicle. The secondary objective is to compare lower or higher air and
rolling resistance effects. Each estimate should be based off of data your
group collects, and should be supplemented or supported by values found in
relevant scientific literature.

The aims are to:

- Design and execute two simple experiments to collect the necessary data
  needed for calculating air and rolling resistance estimates.
- Calculate reasonable estimates for the two losses for a vehicle and rider of
  your choice.
- Show the effect of self-chosen vehicle/rider modification that affects the
  air resistance estimates.
- Show the effect of self-chosen vehicle/rider modification that affects the
  rolling resistance estimates.
- Report on your experiment and result in the light of available information
  from sports engineering scientific literature.

In total, you will need data from a minimum of 4 trials: air resistance,
rolling resistance, modified air resistance, modified rolling resistance.

Assignment 2: Estimate Athlete Power Capacity
=============================================

The objective of this assignment is to estimate both aerobic and anaerobic
capacity for at least two members of your group. Each capacity type estimate
should be based off of data your group collects, but should be supplemented or
supported by values found in relevant scientific literature.

The aims are to:

- Design and execute simple experiments using measurement tools at your
  disposal to collect the necessary data needed for your estimates.
- Calculate reasonable estimates for the aerobic and anaerobic capacity of the
  chosen athletes.
- Compare the aerobic and anaerobic capacities of two members of your group.
- Report on your experiment and result in the light of available information
  from sports engineering scientific literature.

Assignment 3: Predict Race Duration
===================================

The objective of this assignment is to predict the duration for a race against
time over a real cycling route between 400 and 1000 meters long for at least
one member of your group and two scenarios of your choice. A windless, flat,
straight route will offer an easier prediction whereas wind, grade, and
directional variations will be more challenging. The complexity is your choice
(well, unless mother nature makes the choice for you).

The aims are to:

- Develop a computational model to estimate the race time for your chosen route
  based on collected data and work done in the prior assignments.
- Collect necessary data for the race to make your time prediction using your
  cycling power balance model.
- Show the effect of a self-chosen modification of your vehicle/rider or course
  variation on the final time.
- Report on your experiment and result in the light of available information
  from sports engineering scientific literature.

In total you will need data from a minimum of 2 trials: with and without a
vehicle/rider modification or course variation.

Assessment
==========

Intermediate Reporting
----------------------

At each reporting activity in the schedule (one for each assignment) each group
will be expected to submit a 2 page PDF written document and make a (strictly)
3 minute presentation to the class. At least one scientific literature resource
should be used and cited in each of these reports. Submit a PDF of the report
and a PDF of the slide deck. The instructors will provide unstructured written
and verbal feedback to your group before the next assignment is introduced.

Final Report
------------

Each group should submit a maximum 6 page PDF final report including methods,
results, and discussion based on the three intermediate reports and your final
work by Friday, June 18th. At least three scientific resource should be used
and cited.

Final Presentation
------------------

Each group will present a maximum 15 minute presentation the afternoon of
Friday June 11th. The presentation will be followed by 5 minutes of Q & A. You
should present your model predictions to the class, including the procedures
and results of assignments 1 & 2 on which your predictions are based. Submit a
PDF of the slide deck along with your final report and peer review.

Peer Review
-----------

Each student in the class will submit a structured review of contributions of
yourself and your group members alongside the final report by June 18th.

Grading
-------

For the students collecting course credit, the grade will be either a "pass" or
a "fail". To pass your group needs to receive a "pass" assessment on each
report, you must participate in the group presentations, and each student
should receive a satisfactory peer review score from their group members.
