The assignments will be done in groups comprised of four or five students. The
groups will be formed to mix students from the participating universities and
differing disciplines. The groups will be assigned before arrival. You'll have
opportunity to get to know each other on the first day. You'll perform your
experiment on one or more riders from your group and their chosen human-powered
wheeled vehicle.

Groups will need to make use of simple tools and accessible data at your
disposal: tape measures, kilometer markers, stopwatches, smartphone sensors,
cameras, video cameras, GIS downloads, etc. Be clever and resourceful!

At least one consistent rider should participate in all three assignments so
that you can use the data from assignments 1 and 2 to support assignment 3 at
the velodrome.

Assignment 1: Estimate Athlete Power Capacity
=============================================

The objective of this assignment is to estimate aerobic capacity in two ways
and anaerobic capacity in one way for at least one member of your group. Both
capacity results should be based off of data your group collects, but should be
supplemented or supported by values found in relevant scientific literature.
You will have the option to do a Wingate and VO2-Max test in the bicycle lab
for one subject per team, so the second aerobic test should be using a simple
method. [1]_

The aims are to:

- Design and execute simple experiments using measurement tools at your
  disposal to collect the necessary data needed for your estimates.
- Calculate reasonable estimates for the aerobic and anaerobic capacity of the
  chosen athlete(s).
- Compare the aerobic capacities from the two methods and report on the
  anaerobic capacity of the single method.
- Report on your experiment and result in the light of available information
  from sports engineering scientific literature.

.. [1] Your team may opt out of performing the Wingate and VO2max tests. In
   that case, use simpler tests, another team's data, or data from literature.

Assignment 2: Estimate Air and Rolling Resistance
=================================================

The primary objective of this assignment is to estimate the contributions of
air resistance and rolling resistance for at least one member of your group and
their vehicle. The secondary objective is to compare (drastic) lower or higher
air and rolling resistance effects (be creative!).  Each estimate should be
based off of data your group collects in experimentation and should be
supplemented or supported by values found in relevant scientific literature
and/or analytical calculations.

The aims are to:

- Design and execute two simple experiments to collect the necessary data
  needed for calculating air and rolling resistance estimates.
- Calculate reasonable estimates for the two losses for a vehicle and rider of
  your choice.
- Show the effect of self-chosen vehicle/rider modification that affects the
  air resistance estimates.
- Show the effect of self-chosen vehicle/rider modification that affects the
  rolling resistance estimates.
- Report on your experiment and result in the light of available information
  from sports engineering scientific literature.

In total, you will need data from a minimum of 4 trials: air resistance,
rolling resistance, modified air resistance, modified rolling resistance.
Select a vehicle and athlete that you will also use for the third assignment at
the velodrome. The vehicle cannot be larger than a normal bicycle.

Submit the report to your teams channel "Files" by the deadline and prepare a
lightning talk to give during class on the results of your assignment.

   Assignment 3: Predict Race Duration
   ===================================

   The objective of this assignment is to predict the duration of each of two laps
   in a race against time and also the distance of a coast down for at least one
   member of your group and two scenarios of your choice. At least one scenario
   should be significantly different than simply a time trial of a race bike on
   the track. For example, think about tire type and pressure, aerodynamic
   changes, drafting, unusual bicycles (cargo, tandem, omafiets, etc.).

   Each scenario should consist of three+ consecutive laps in the safety zone
   (flat part below the gray part):

   - One lap from a standstill to top speed
   - One lap at max speed
   - Lap(s) from coasting from max speed to standstill

   The three predictions you should make are:

   - Duration of first lap
   - Duration of second lap
   - Distance of coast down

   Submit your values by 12:00 on Friday to the instructors.

   The aims are to:

   - Develop a computational model to estimate the race times and coast distance
     in the velodrome based on collected data and work done in the prior
     assignments.
   - Collect necessary data for the race to make your time prediction using your
     cycling power balance model.
   - Compare the two scenarios and how well you were able to predict both,
     explaining why.
   - Report on your experiment and result in the light of available information
     from sports engineering scientific literature.

   In total you will need data from a minimum of 2 trials, one data set from each
   scenario.
