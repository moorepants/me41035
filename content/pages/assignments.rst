Assignments
===========

:sortorder: 1

The assignments will be done in groups comprised of four or five students. The
groups will be formed to mix students from the participating universities and
differing disciplines. The groups will be assigned the first day with an
opportunity to get to know each other. You'll experiment on one or more riders
from your group and their chosen human-powered wheeled vehicle.

Groups will need to make use of simple tools and accessible data at your
disposal: tape measures, kilometer markers, stopwatches, smartphone sensors,
cameras, video cameras, GIS downloads, etc. Be clever!

Assignment 1: Estimate Air and Rolling Resistance
=================================================

The objective of this assignment is to estimate the contributions of air
resistance and rolling resistance for at least one member of your group and
their vehicle. Each estimate should be based off of data your group collects,
but can (and should) be supplemented or supported by values found in relevant
scientific literature.

The aims are to:

- Design and execute simple experiments using measurement tools at your
  disposal to collect the necessary data needed for your estimates.
- Calculate reasonable estimates for the two losses for the vehicle and rider
  of your choice.
- Show the effect of self-chosen vehicle/rider modifications that likely affect
  each of the resistance estimates.
- Report on your experiment and result in the light of available information
  from sports engineering scientific literature.

Report your methods and results in a two page written document submitted as a
PDF as well as in a three minute presentation. At least one scientific resource
should be used and cited.

Assignment 2: Estimate Athlete Power Capacity
=============================================

The objective of this assignment is to estimate both aerobic and anaerobic
capacity for at least two members of your group. Each capacity type estimate
should be based off of data your group collects, but can (and should) be
supplemented or supported by values found in relevant scientific literature.

The aims are to:

- Design and execute simple experiments using measurement tools at your
  disposal to collect the necessary data needed for your estimates.
- Calculate reasonable estimates for the aerobic and anaerobic capacity of the
  chosen athletes.
- Compare the aerobic and anaerobic capacities of two members of your group.
- Report on your experiment and result in the light of available information
  from sports engineering scientific literature.

Report your methods and results in a two page written document submitted as a
PDF as well as in a three minute presentation. At least one scientific resource
should be used and cited.

Assignment 3: Predict Race Finish Time
======================================

The objective of this assignment is to predict the finish time for a race
against time over a real cycling route between 400 and 1000 meters for at least
one member of your group in two scenarios. A windless, flat, straight route
will offer an easier prediction whereas wind, grade, and direction variations
will be more challenging. The complexity is your choice (well, unless mother
nature makes the choice for you).

The aims are to:

- Develop a computational model to estimate the race time for your chosen route
  based on collected data and work done in the prior assignments.
- Collect necessary data for the race to make your time prediction using the
  cycling power balance model.
- Show the effect of a self-chosen modifications of your vehicle or rider on
  the final time.
- Report on your experiment and result in the light of available information
  from sports engineering scientific literature.

Report your methods and results in a two page written document submitted as a
PDF as well as in a three minute presentation. At least one scientific resource
should be used and cited.

Assessment
==========

Intermediate Reporting
----------------------

At each reporting activity in the schedule (one for each assignment) you will
be expected to submit a 2 page PDF written document and make a strictly 3
minute presentation to the class. The instructors will provide unstructured
written and verbal feedback to your group before the next assignment is
introduced.

Final Report
------------

A maximum 6 page PDF final report on the methods and results based on the three
intermediate documents will be submitted by Friday, June 18th.

Final Presentation
------------------

Each group will present a maximum 15 minute presentation the afternoon of
Friday June 11th. The presentation will be followed by 5 minutes of Q & A. You
should present your model predictions to the class, including the procedures
and results of assignments 1 & 2 on which your predictions are based.

Following this presentation you will present the "live" test of your
prediction, by having your group rider actually race the stretch for which your
prediction was made.

Peer Review
-----------

You will submit a structured review of contributions by  yourself and your
group members alongside the final report by June 18th.

Grading
-------

For the students collecting course credit, the grade will be either a "pass" or
a "fail". To pass your group needs to receive a "pass" assessment on each
assignment, you must participate in the final group presentation, and each
student should receive a satisfactory peer review score from their group
members.

In case of a "fail", a re-assessment can be taken based on an additional
individual assignment, but only if all assignments are done the student did
participate in the group presentations. The assignment will comprise a brief
literature review related one of the classes of the course.
