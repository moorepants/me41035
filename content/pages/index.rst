Special Topics in Sports Engineering is an inter-university course for Master
students in Mechanical Engineering, Movement Sciences, Sport Sciences and other
related MSc programmes. The course is organised as a two-week intensive course,
and comprises lectures, demonstrations, practicals, hands-on research and a
final field test. The course will be taught by staff from Delft University of
Technology, Sheffield Hallam University and VU Amsterdam. The course is
organised around a basic theme relevant for sports engineering. In 2016 - 2017
this theme will be “Maximizing cycling performance”. During the course students
will work out what aspects determine cycling performance, and collect data
(through experiments or literature research) that are needed to develop / feed
a simulation programme for the estimation of the optimal bike – rider
combination and the maximal performance humanly possible. The course’s final
activity will be a test ride to quantify the differences between actual
performance and predicted performance.

Study Goals
===========

After following this course, students should understand the complexity of
maximizing sports performance and the importance of the inclusion of material –
athlete interaction. More specifically, students should be:

- Familiar with the Power Equation[1] concept and be able to apply this to
  cycling;
- have knowledge of methodological aspects of sports research, in particular
  error propagation, man – machine interaction (closed loop complexity),
  measurement techniques, internal and external validity.
- have insight in the organizational and psychological complexities of sports
  innovation.
- Able to measure key parameters needed for power equations, related to their
  own field and have experience in the measurement of key parameters in
  adjacent fields[2];
- able to provide a cycling performance simulation programme with the
  parameters necessary to evaluate performance on a realistic level;
- able to collect and present to fellow group members, data on parameters for
  such a simulation program.
- present research findings through an individual portfolio, and a group
  presentation/poster/brief oral.
