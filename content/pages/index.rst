*Special Topics in Sports Engineering* is an inter-university course for Master
students in Mechanical Engineering, Movement Sciences, Sport Sciences, and
other related MSc programs. The course is organized as a two-week intensive
course and comprises lectures, demonstrations, practicals, hands-on research,
and a final field test. The course will be taught by staff from the six
participating universities. Due to the ongoing coronavirus situation, this
year's course will again be online.

The course is organised around a basic theme relevant for sports engineering
and this year's theme will be "Maximizing cycling performance". During the
course students will work out what aspects determine cycling performance, and
collect data (through experiments or literature research) that are needed to
develop and feed a simulation program for the estimation of the optimal
bicycle–rider combination and the maximal performance humanly possible. The
course's final activity will be a test ride to quantify the differences between
actual performance and predicted performance.

In this course, students will have to answer the question:

   Given a particular bike, what will be your own predicted time over a given
   distance and track and how well does this match reality?

The prediction should be based on a power-based simulation model of cycling and
the relevant bicycle and rider dependent parameters, which have to be collected
experimentally. Answering this question will require insight in relevant
parameters, but also collecting these parameters, for each individual student
with his or her individual bike. The bike in question can be chosen freely and
might therefore be a top-end racing bike as well as your grandmother's shopping
bike.

Study Goals
===========

After following this course, students should understand the complexity of
maximizing sports performance and the importance of the inclusion of
material–athlete interaction. More specifically, students should be:

- Familiar with the Power Equation concept and be able to apply this to
  cycling;
- have knowledge of methodological aspects of sports research, in particular
  error propagation, man–machine interaction (closed loop complexity),
  measurement techniques, internal and external validity.
- have insight in the organizational and psychological complexities of sports
  innovation.
- Able to measure key parameters needed for power equations, related to their
  own field and have experience in the measurement of key parameters in
  adjacent fields;
- able to provide a cycling performance simulation program with the parameters
  necessary to evaluate performance on a realistic level;
- able to collect and present to fellow group members, data on parameters for
  such a simulation program.
- present research findings through an individual portfolio, and a group
  presentation/poster/brief oral.

Dates
=====

The course will occur over the two weeks of **May 31, 2021 to June 11, 2021**
with activities scheduled throughout the day from Monday to Friday each week.

**Due to the ongoing coronavirus situation, the course will be held
virtually.**

Registration
============

Students will register with the coordinator at their home university. There are
limited slots for students from each of the participating universities. Excess
students will be placed on a waiting list. Slots will be filled on a first
come, first serve basis.

**Registration deadline is April 16, 2021.**

Reach out to your university's coordinator to find out how to register:
