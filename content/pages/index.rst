*Special Topics in Sports Engineering* is an inter-university course for Master
students in Mechanical Engineering, Movement Sciences, Sport Sciences, and
other related MSc programs. The course is organized as a two-week intensive
course and comprises lectures, demonstrations, practicals, hands-on research,
and a final field test. The course is taught by various experts from different
scientific domains.

The course is organized around a basic theme relevant for sports engineering
and this year's theme will be "maximizing cycling performance". During the
course students will work out what aspects determine cycling performance, and
collect data (through experiments or literature research) that are needed to
develop and feed a simulation program for the estimation of the optimal
bicycle–rider combination and the maximal performance humanly possible. The
course's final activity will be a test ride to quantify the differences between
actual performance and predicted performance.

In this course, students will have to answer the question:

   Given a particular bike, what will be your own predicted time over a given
   distance and track and how well does this match reality?

The prediction should be based on a power-based simulation model of cycling and
the relevant bicycle and rider dependent parameters, which have to be collected
experimentally. Answering this question will require insight in relevant
parameters, but also collecting these parameters, for each individual student
with his or her individual bike. The bike in question can be chosen freely and
might therefore be a top-end racing bike as well as your grandmother's shopping
bike.

Study Goals
===========

After following this course, students should understand the complexity of
maximizing sports performance and the importance of the inclusion of
material–athlete interaction. More specifically, students should be:

- Familiar with the Power Equation concept and be able to apply this to
  cycling;
- Have knowledge of methodological aspects of sports research, in particular
  error propagation, man–machine interaction (closed loop complexity),
  measurement techniques, internal and external validity.
- Have insight in the organizational and psychological complexities of sports
  innovation.
- Able to measure key parameters needed for power equations, related to their
  own field and have experience in the measurement of key parameters in
  adjacent fields;
- Able to provide a cycling performance simulation program with the parameters
  necessary to evaluate performance on a realistic level;
- Able to collect and present to fellow group members, data on parameters for
  such a simulation program.
- Present research findings through an individual portfolio, and a group
  presentation/poster/brief oral.

Dates
=====

   :class: alert alert-warning

   The course will occur over the two weeks of **June 30, 2025 to July 11,
   2025** with activities scheduled throughout the day from Monday to Friday
   each week. The course will be in person in Delft!

   If there are not enough registered students, it is possible that the course
   will not be taught in 2025, so spread the word!

Credits
=======

The course is designed as a 3 EC course, but packed into two weeks. Some of the
participating universities will award you the credits; ask your coordinator for
more information.

Registration
============

Students will register with the coordinator at their home university. There are
a guaranteed number of slots for students from each of the participating
universities. Excess students will be placed on a waiting list. Slots will be
filled on a first come, first serve basis.

**The registration deadline is March 1, 2025.**

Registration timeline:

- February 1, 2025: Registration is open.
- March 1, 2025: Registration deadline.
- April 1, 2025: Students are informed of their team placement and asked to
  confirm.
- May 1, 2025: Final confirmation of participation.

Reach out to your university's coordinator to find out how to register:

Communication
=============

We will make use of the `Microsoft Teams`_ platform for all course
communication and hybrid lectures. We will use a "Team" named "Special Topics
in Sports Engineering 2025" for announcements, hybrid lectures, and channels
will also be available for your group to use for group work.  Hopefully, all
communication about the class will stay within the team to simplify working
across multiple universities and countries. Steps to getting access to the
team:

- Download and install the Microsoft Teams software (free for use on all major
  desktop platforms).
- If you are TU Delft student or employee, open Teams and log in with your TU
  Delft netid. Once logged in, you should see the "Special Topics in Sports
  Engineering 2025" team under "Teams" in the MS Teams application. You are
  done.
- If you are not with TU Delft, create a free `Microsoft account`_ then check
  the email you registered with for the course for an invitation to the team.
  The subject should be something like "You have been added as a guest to Delft
  University of Technology in Microsoft Teams".
- Click the "Open Microsoft Teams" link in the email and sign into MS Teams
  with your Microsoft account. You should see the "Special Topics in Sports
  Engineering 2025" team under "Teams" in the MS Teams application. You are
  done.

It is important to access the team the week before class and report any issues
to the teaching assistant for access help. We have had some connection issues
in the past.

If you are not registered for the course but would like to join the live
lectures, send an email to the teaching assistant with a request to be added.

To join the live lectures and activities:

1. Open the Microsoft Teams application.
2. Select "Teams" and then "Special Topics in Sports Engineering 2025".
3. Select the "General" channel (if not already selected).
4. Wait for the video meeting to start and select "Join" when the meeting is
   active.

Lecturers may upload any files for the students to the General channel's
"Files" "Class Materials" folder. All members of the MS Team will have access
to the files.

Assessment
==========

**All assessment documents should be submitted as a PDF to the "Files" area of
your group's private channel in the "Sports Engineering 2025" MS Team.**

Intermediate Reporting
----------------------

At each reporting activity in the schedule (one for each assignment) each group
will be expected to submit a PDF written document with 2 pages of content max
and make a (strictly) 3 minute presentation to the class. At least two
scientific literature resources should be used and cited in each of these
reports. The title, author list, and bibliography do not count against the page
limit. Submit a PDF of the report and a PDF of the slide deck to the "Files"
section of your group's MS Team channel by the end of the reporting activity
period. The instructors will provide unstructured written and verbal feedback
to your group before the next assignment is introduced.

Final Report
------------

Each group should submit a PDF final report with maximum of 6 pages of content
including methods, results, and discussion based on the two intermediate
reports and your final work by 23:59 Friday July 18th, 2025. At least six
scientific literature resources should be used and cited. The title, author
list, and bibliography do not count against the page limit.

Final Presentation
------------------

Each group will present a maximum 10 minute presentation the afternoon of the
last day. The presentation will be followed by 5 minutes of Q & A. You should
present your model predictions and its comparison to the measured race duration
to the class, including the procedures and results of assignments 1 & 2 on
which your predictions are based. Submit a PDF of the slide deck along with
your final report and peer review.

Peer Review
-----------

Each student in the class will submit a structured review of contributions of
yourself and your group members alongside the final report one week after the
last day of the course. A form will be provided for this.

Grading
-------

For the students collecting course credit, the grade will be either a "pass" or
a "fail". To pass your group needs to receive a "pass" assessment on each
report, you must participate in the group presentations, and each student
should receive a satisfactory peer review score from their group members.
