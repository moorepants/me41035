Are there fixed lessons each day from 9:00 to 17:00?

   No, there will be about 2 hours of in-class lectures and a few days will
   have up to an extra 2 hours of activities. We'll try to plan each lecture
   for a mid-morning start time, but some lecturers may need to give the
   lectures earlier or later in the day. The `schedule
   <{filename}/pages/schedul.rst>`_ will be updated as we finalize the lessons.

How many hours of work is required over the two weeks?

   The course is worth 3 ECs, so expect a full time work load.

Do we work in teams?

   Yes, you will be in a multidisciplinary international team and will work with
   that team for each assignment.

How will the course be delivered given the coronavirus measures?

   The lectures, workshops, discussions, etc. will be delivered online via a
   video chat service. You will work with your team remotely, as some members
   will be in different locations. The practical aspects of the assignments
   will be performed at home using simple engineering tools and methods. For
   team members that happen to be in the same location, they may work together
   in person as long as they are following the local coronavirus regulations.

Can I register myself?

   Each University will have a different way to register. See the information
   provided on the `main page <{filename}/pages/index.rst#registration>`_ or
   contact the coordinator at your University.
