Will this course be online?
   The course will be in person in Delft. Some of the lectures will be
   delivered in a hybrid fashion, but all students are expected to be present
   in Delft for the two weeks.
Are there fixed lessons each day from 9:00 to 17:00?
   No, there will be about 2 hours of in-class lectures and a some days will
   have up to an extra 2 hours of activities. We'll try to plan each lecture
   for a mid-morning start time, but some lecturers may need to give the
   lectures earlier or later in the day. For early planning purposes **reserve
   8:00-22:00 for each day of the course in your personal agenda**. If the
   course is in person there will also be travel to sites around the
   Netherlands on some days, taking much of the day. The `schedule
   <{filename}/pages/schedul.rst>`_ will be updated as we finalize the lessons.
How many hours of work is required over the two weeks?
   The course is worth 3 ECs (~84 hrs), so expect a full time work load for the
   two weeks.
Do we work in teams?
   Yes, you will be in a multidisciplinary international team and will work
   with that team for each assignment.
Can I register myself?
   Each University will have a different way to register. See the information
   provided on the `main page <{filename}/pages/index.rst#registration>`_ or
   contact the coordinator at your University. Typically, you email your home
   coordinator by the registration deadline.
Do you arrange our travel and accommodation?
   No, we do not. But we do provide some tips for you on the `travel &
   accomodation <{filename}/pages/travel.rst>`_ page.
